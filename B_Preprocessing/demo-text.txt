Salsa is a black cat from Tennessee. Salsa is an example of what happens when you walk into the pet supply store for dog food, and somehow walk out with a cat. We have the people who bring adoptable pets in from the animal shelter to thank for that. Nobody knows who Salsa was in her past life, but now she is a lazy house cat who looks like a big round furry bowling ball on four little stick-like legs.

Her hobbies include eating flies and sleeping. Salsa would like to fit into a basket that clearly doesn't hold her. But Salsa is determined. She isn't going to let a little thing like the Laws of Physics stand in her way. Come to think of it, most cats don't pay attention to physics anyways.

I suppose that's because cats already have such a profound understanding of the nature of the universe, that they are able to bend it to their will-- as evidenced by their ability to manipulate their bodies in unfathomable ways, and to perform physical feats which defy reason.
